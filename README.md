# Password-Generator

##Description

The purpose of this project was to be able to generate new unigue passwords. Along with allowing user input as to what kind of characters the user wishes to have within the password. This project taught me how to research new and exciting ways to apply javascript into projects. 




##Usage

The user when pressing the button will be greeted with several prompts asking as to how long and what characters they wish to use in their password.
